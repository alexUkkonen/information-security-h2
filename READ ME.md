## Locheed Martin on countering APT
* Active defense is important, don't rely on an antivirus if you could be targeted by a APT. This is because an anti-virus can only react to discovered threats and if something is created specifically for use on your company it can easily bypass the anti-virus.
* A kill chain consists of: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command & Control, and Actions on Objectives.
* If you disrupt any part the whole chain falls
* When defending a killchain use: Detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, destroy.
* Reveal, mature, utilize and discover. Analyze thereats as they get caught, find indicators, use these indicators to catch more threats and search for more patterns

### Tactic
* A tactic is the why of a cyber attack. What do they want to achieve?
* Example: goal is to encrypt target database and ask for a randsom in exchange for decrypting it again.

### Technique and Sub-technique
* A technique is the how on a general level. Example: Phishing
* A sub-techinque is the detailed version of the how. Example: Spearphishing with a link trough a spoofed internal Gmail.

### Procedure
* Proceduere is the exact way the attacker preformed the attack. Example: Spearphishing with a link that takes you to a site requesting your credentials for a security update trough a spoofed internal Gmail that looks like it came from your IT department.
